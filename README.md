# Secure NSUserDefaults
Secure NSUserDefaults allows you to protect your user defaults against unauthorized modifications on iOS and Mac OS X. You can also link user defaults to the machine they’ve been created on which makes plist sharing impossible. Please note that this implementation does **not** use encryption. It is therefore **not** suitable to store sensitive data.

## Usage
Add `NSUserDefaults+MPSecureUserDefaults.h` and `NSUserDefaults+MPSecureUserDefaults.m` to your project. Secure NSUserDefaults expects a secret to generate app-specific hashes. If you intend to link your user defaults to the machine they’ve been created on, you’ll also have to pass a unique device identifier. The included example illustrates how to retrieve that identifier on both platforms, iOS and Mac OS X.
    #import "NSUserDefaults+MPSecureUserDefaults.h"
    
    // ...
    
    // Configuring user defaults. It is recommended that you do this
    // immediately after the app did launch.
    [NSUserDefaults setSecret:@"shh, this is secret!"];

    // Write secure user defaults
	NSUserDefaults *defaults = [NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults];
    [defaults setSecureBool:YES forKey:@"IsRegistered"];
    
    // Read secure user defaults
    BOOL valid = NO;
    BOOL registered = [defaults secureBoolForKey:@"IsRegistered" valid:&valid];
    if (!valid) {
	    // the property has been modified, handle this situation
    } else {
	    // Valid property, do whatever you need to do
    }

## Notes
* Secure NSUserDefaults mimics the non-secure NSUserDefaults methods
* A key that doesn’t exist yet is considered valid
* Do not read your secret from any resource but write it directly into your code
* Accessors for invalid properties will still return the value, it is therefore necessary to always check the valid out-pointer!
